"Small-Town Charm in the Heart of Silicon Valley."

Known for its quiet, tree-lined streets, lack of through traffic (thanks to its design and traffic circles), and a strong sense of community where original homeowners mix with young families. Stevenson Park is widely considered the "heart" of the neighborhood.
