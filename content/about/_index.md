### Location & Boundaries

Rex Manor is centrally located in Mountain View, making it highly walkable and bikeable.

*   **North:** West Middlefield Road
*   **East:** South Shoreline Boulevard
*   **South:** Central Expressway
*   **West:** Farley Street

A defining feature of Rex Manor is that it has almost no "through streets" that cut all the way from one side to the other. This design, along with numerous traffic circles, keeps streets quiet and safe for walking.

### Neighborhood History & Architecture

The neighborhood was developed primarily in the **1950s and 1960s**. The visual character is defined by **single-story Ranch-style homes** typical of the mid-century boom. While many homes have been renovated or expanded, the neighborhood retains a cohesive, low-profile aesthetic.

In recent years, there has been a trend of "tech families" moving in, resulting in some new construction, but a significant number of original owners still live here, contributing to the stable, long-term feel of the community.
