Happy Saturday, Rex Manor!

David Watson here with a quick update on what's happening around town as we settle into the second half of January. I hope everyone is having a great start to 2026.

## City Services: MLK Jr. Day

A quick reminder that this Monday, January 19th, is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. While City administrative offices will be closed, **trash and recycling collection will occur as scheduled**. If your regular pickup day is Monday, please have your carts out by 6 a.m. as usual. There is no delay for the holiday week.

## Community & Tech Events

We are fortunate to have two incredible hubs of innovation right in our backyard.

**[Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.com/)** (Maude Ave) is hosting some fantastic events to close out the month:
*   **[Project Jam](https://hackerdojo.com/events/)** – Saturday, Jan 31 at 1:00 PM. Bring your personal coding or hardware projects and work alongside other local makers.

Just down the road, the **[Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)** has a busy schedule:
*   **Special Holiday Hours** – The museum will be **OPEN** this Monday, Jan 19 (MLK Day) from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., a rare Monday opening!
*   **["Read Me"](https://computerhistory.org/events/)** – Tuesday, Jan 20 at 7:00 PM. A CHM Live event exploring the stories behind the code.
*   **["Algorithms of Love"](https://computerhistory.org/events/)** – Wednesday, Feb 4 at 7:00 PM. A look at how technology intersects with human connection, just in time for Valentine's season.

Supporting these local institutions helps keep our city at the forefront of the tech world!

## Arts & Culture

Over at the **[Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com)**, there are a few treats coming up:

*   **["The Snow Queen"](https://www.mvcpa.com/events-tickets)** by Peninsula Youth Theatre continues its run through this weekend.
*   **[Hershey Felder as George Gershwin Alone](https://www.mvcpa.com/events-tickets)** opens later next week. This is a highly acclaimed show and a great excuse for a night out downtown.

For tickets and times, check the [MVCPA website](https://www.mvcpa.com).

## Stay Connected

As always, keep an eye on the [Rex Manor Neighbors Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors) for real-time discussions and neighborly advice.

Have a wonderful long weekend!
