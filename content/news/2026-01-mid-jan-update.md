Happy Saturday, Rex Manor!

David Watson here with a quick update on what's happening around town as we settle into the second half of January. I hope everyone is having a great start to 2026.

## City Services: MLK Jr. Day

A quick reminder that this Monday, January 19th, is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. While City administrative offices will be closed, **trash and recycling collection will occur as scheduled**. If your regular pickup day is Monday, please have your carts out by 6 a.m. as usual. There is no delay for the holiday week.

## Community & Tech Events

We are fortunate to have the **Hacker Dojo** right in our backyard on Maude Ave. They are hosting some fantastic events to close out the month:

*   **Cloud Security Meetup** – Thursday, Jan 29 at 6:00 PM. A great opportunity for professionals to discuss the latest in cloud infrastructure.
*   **Project Jam** – Saturday, Jan 31 at 1:00 PM. Bring your personal coding or hardware projects and work alongside other local makers. It's a wonderful way to see the innovation happening right here in Mountain View.

Supporting these local hubs helps keep our city at the forefront of the tech world!

## Arts & Culture

Over at the **Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts**, there are a few treats coming up:

*   **"The Snow Queen"** by Peninsula Youth Theatre continues its run through this weekend.
*   **Hershey Felder as George Gershwin Alone** opens later next week. This is a highly acclaimed show and a great excuse for a night out downtown.

For tickets and times, check the [MVCPA website](https://www.mvcpa.com).

## Stay Connected

As always, keep an eye on the [Rex Manor Neighbors Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors) for real-time discussions and neighborly advice.

Have a wonderful long weekend!
