Happy New Year, Rex Manor!

I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season and is ready for a fantastic 2026. It’s always refreshing to see our neighborhood buzzing with activity, and I’m looking forward to what this year brings for all of us.

## From the Neighborhood

Over on the [Rex Manor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors), there’s been some great discussion lately. A quick reminder about the **Dark Sky Ordinance** survey mentioned in recent threads. If you haven't yet, it's worth taking a look at how we can balance safety with preserving our night sky.
