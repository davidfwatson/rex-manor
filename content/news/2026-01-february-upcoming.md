As January winds down, it's time to look ahead at what February has in store for us here in Mountain View. Living in Rex Manor puts us right in the middle of a vibrant community that seamlessly blends technology with the arts. Here are a few upcoming events that caught my eye.

### Tech & Innovation
Our local tech scene is always buzzing with positive energy and new ideas.

*   **Computer History Museum:** On **Wednesday, February 4, 2026, at 7:00 PM**, the CHM is hosting **"Algorithms of Love."** This CHM Live event explores the fascinating intersection of technology and human relationships. It's a great reminder of how tech continues to shape our lives in meaningful ways. [Learn more here](https://computerhistory.org/events/).
*   **Hacker Dojo:** If you're looking to get your hands dirty with some code or hardware, check out the **Build & Chill Project Jam** on **Wednesday, February 4**. It’s a fantastic way to meet fellow makers and see the creativity thriving in our backyard. The Dojo is a true gem for fostering innovation. [More info](https://www.meetup.com/hackerdojo/).

### Arts & Entertainment
The [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) has a wonderful lineup for families and culture lovers alike.

*   **The Snow Queen:** Catch the final performances of this winter classic on **January 31 and February 1**. It's a perfect outing if you missed it earlier in the month.
*   **Kismet with Kali:** On **Saturday, February 7**, experience a beautiful solo Bharatanatyam recital. It’s wonderful to see such diverse cultural expressions on our local stage.

### Neighborhood Notes
Don't forget to keep an eye on the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group. It's our virtual town square for everything from lost pets to impromptu get-togethers.

See you around the neighborhood!
