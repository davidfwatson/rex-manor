Welcome to February, neighbors!

As we move into the second month of 2026, there are some fantastic opportunities to engage with our local tech culture and participate in the future planning of our community spaces. Here is what is happening in and around Rex Manor this month.

### Computer History Museum: Tech & Connection
Our neighborhood's proximity to the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) is a real privilege, offering us world-class events right in our backyard.

*   **Algorithms of Love:** On **Wednesday, February 4, 2026, at 7:00 PM**, the museum is hosting a fascinating CHM Live event titled "Algorithms of Love." This promises to be an insightful exploration of how technology intersects with human connection and relationships. It’s a perfect example of how the tech industry continues to shape our social fabric in positive and interesting ways.
*   **Retro Games:** If you are looking for a fun weekend activity with the family (or just want to relive some nostalgia), the "Retro Games" exhibit is currently showing. It is a great way to celebrate the history of gaming innovation.

### Community News: Parks Strategic Plan
There is an important discussion happening on the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group regarding the **Updated Draft Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan**, which was released for review in late January.

This is a key moment to have your voice heard concerning the future of our local green spaces, including our very own **Rex Manor Park** (the "tot lot"). I encourage everyone to check the Google Group for the link to the plan and share your feedback. Engaging with these city initiatives is how we ensure our neighborhood amenities continue to thrive and evolve.

### City Services: President's Day
Looking ahead, **Monday, February 16** is President's Day.
*   **City Offices:** Expect City of Mountain View offices to be closed in observance of the holiday.
*   **Trash Collection:** Typically, Recology Mountain View does *not* alter the collection schedule for President's Day (shifts usually only occur for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's). Unless you hear otherwise, you can expect your trash and recycling pickup to follow the **regular schedule** this week.

### Stay Connected
If you haven't yet, please join the conversation on our **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group. It is the best way to stay updated on these kinds of community topics—like the Parks Plan—in real-time.

Have a wonderful February!
