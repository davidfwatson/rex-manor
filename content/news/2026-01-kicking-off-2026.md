Happy New Year, Rex Manor!

I hope everyone had a restful holiday season. It's time to look forward to what 2026 has in store for our community.

**Downtown Updates**

For those who visit City Hall or the Library, note that the **Lot 12 parking lot** (across from City Hall) is scheduled to close this month to make way for a new affordable housing project. Construction is anticipated to begin in January/February. It's exciting to see our city continuing to grow and provide more housing options. Just be sure to plan a little extra time for parking if you're heading downtown!

**Upcoming Events at MVCPA**

The Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts has a great lineup for families this winter and spring. Here are a few dates to mark on your calendar:

*   **[The Adventures of Pinocchio](https://tickets.mvcpa.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=720)** by Peninsula Youth Theatre opens on **January 17**. A classic tale that's sure to be a hit with the kids.
*   **[Martina the Beautiful Cockroach](https://tickets.mvcpa.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=721)** follows on **February 14**.
*   Looking ahead, **Hansel and Gretel** will be performed in April, and **Dragons Love Tacos** in May.

**Neighborhood News**

On the **[Rex Manor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors)**, it's been great to see neighbors helping neighbors—whether it's sharing recommendations for local plumbers or passing along information about community surveys. If you're not on the list yet, it's a valuable resource for staying connected.

Here's to a fantastic 2026 for Rex Manor and Mountain View!

Best,

David Watson
