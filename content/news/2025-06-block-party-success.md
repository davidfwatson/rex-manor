Thank you everyone for coming to the Annual Block Party on Sunday, June 22! It was great to see you all and to welcome new faces to the neighborhood. Hundreds of people attended, making this perhaps the best attendance since we started the event!

A special thank you to the Watsons for applying for the grant money and organizing the food and supplies.

We also want to thank:
*   All the volunteers who distributed flyers.
*   The food prep team (cutting watermelons, cantaloupe, tomatoes, onions, peppers, cucumber, lettuce, etc.).
*   Neighbors who lent grills, canopies, tables, and coolers.
*   The setup crew who arrived at 10am to close the street.
*   The Ruzon family for the face painting.
*   The grill masters and servers.
*   Neighbors who shared delicious homemade food and desserts.
*   Everyone who helped with cleanup.

It wouldn't be possible without so many of our neighbors pitching in.

**Tentative date for next year:** Sunday, June 14, 2026. See you there!
