As we move through January, it's time to look ahead at what February has in store for us in Mountain View. It is shaping up to be a busy month, full of the innovation and culture that makes our city such a dynamic place to live.

### Celebrating Innovation
One of the unique privileges of living in Rex Manor is having the tech world's heartbeat right next door.

*   **Computer History Museum:** On **Wednesday, February 4**, the CHM hosts **"Algorithms of Love,"** exploring tech and relationships. Also, catch the **Video Game History Exhibit** before it closes on **February 16**.
*   **SmallSat Symposium:** From **February 10-12**, the [SmallSat Symposium](https://smallsatshow.com/) returns to the museum. While this is an industry event, it brings global aerospace leaders to our neighborhood, putting our city at the center of forward-looking industries.
*   **Hacker Dojo:** Located just down the road at 855 Maude Ave, the Dojo has a full calendar this month, including a **3D Printing Workshop** (Feb 5) and a **Game Night** (Feb 14). It is a great resource for makers and tech enthusiasts.

### Arts & Culture
The [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) continues to offer great performances.

*   **"Love is Love":** Just in time for Valentine's Day, catch this performance on **Friday, Feb 13** and **Saturday, Feb 14**.
*   **"Dual Inspirations":** On **Saturday, February 21**, enjoy an evening of dance and creativity.

### Neighborhood Life
**City Services Update:**
Monday, February 16 is **Presidents' Day**. While City administrative offices and the library will be **closed**, please note that **Recology trash and recycling collection will proceed as usual**. You do not need to put your bins out late.

Finally, don't forget to check the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group for day-to-day discussions and more spontaneous plans.

See you around the neighborhood!
