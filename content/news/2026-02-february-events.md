As we move through January, it's time to look ahead at what February has in store for us in Mountain View. It is shaping up to be a busy month, full of the innovation and culture that makes our city such a dynamic place to live.

### Celebrating Innovation
One of the unique privileges of living in Rex Manor is having the tech world's heartbeat right next door.

*   **Computer History Museum:** On **Wednesday, February 4 at 7:00 PM**, the CHM is hosting a fascinating event titled **"Algorithms of Love,"** exploring how technology influences our relationships.
*   **SmallSat Symposium:** From **February 10-12**, the [SmallSat Symposium](https://smallsatshow.com/) returns to the museum. While this is an industry event, it brings global aerospace leaders to our neighborhood. It is always exciting to see our city at the center of such forward-looking industries.
*   **Last Chance:** If you haven't seen the **Video Game History Exhibit**, catch it before it closes on **February 16**.

Over at **Hacker Dojo** (855 Maude Ave), the community spirit is strong:
*   **3D Printing Workshop:** Curious about making things? Check out their workshop on **Thursday, February 5 at 7:00 PM**.
*   **Hacker's Movie Night:** A casual evening for tech enthusiasts on **Monday, February 16 at 6:30 PM**.

### Arts & Culture
The [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) continues to offer great performances.

*   **"Love is Love":** Just in time for Valentine's Day, catch this performance on **Friday, Feb 13** and **Saturday, Feb 14**.
*   **"Dual Inspirations":** On **Saturday, February 21**, enjoy an evening of dance and creativity.

### Neighborhood Life
If you are looking for a fun, low-key way to spend Valentine's evening (or just a Saturday night), **Hacker Dojo** is also hosting an **"Ultimate Game Night"** on **February 14 at 7:00 PM**. It’s a great example of the diverse, welcoming community spaces we have here.

**City Reminder:** Please note that **Monday, February 16 is Presidents Day**, so City offices and libraries will likely be closed.

Finally, don't forget to check the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group for day-to-day discussions and more spontaneous plans.

See you around the neighborhood!
