Happy Holidays, Rex Manor!

It's been great to see the lively discussions on our [Rex Manor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors) lately. Seeing neighbors helping neighbors and sharing local tips is exactly what makes our community unique. If you haven't joined yet, I highly encourage you to check it out!

As we settle into the festive season, there are plenty of events happening right here in Mountain View to get you into the holiday spirit. Here are a few highlights coming up at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts:

*   **[The Nutcracker](https://tickets.mvcpa.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=716)** by Western Ballet is ongoing through **December 7**.
*   **[Smuin’s The Christmas Ballet](https://www.smuinballet.org/events/christmas-2025/)** runs from **December 11 – 14**.
*   **[The Snow Queen](https://www.bayerballet.com/)** by Bayer Ballet will be performed on **December 19 – 20**.
*   **[17th Annual South Bay Holiday Gospel Concert](https://tickets.mvcpa.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=708)** by the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir is on **December 21**.

Also, if you were up early this morning (Saturday, Dec 6), you might have caught **"When Santa was a Baby"**!

I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season. Let's keep the community spirit strong!

Warmly,

David Watson
