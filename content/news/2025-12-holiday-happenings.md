Happy Holidays, Rex Manor!

It's been great to see the lively discussions on our [Rex Manor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors) lately. Seeing neighbors helping neighbors and sharing local tips is exactly what makes our community unique. If you haven't joined yet, I highly encourage you to check it out!

As we settle into the festive season, there are plenty of events happening right here in Mountain View to get you into the holiday spirit. Here are a few highlights coming up at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts:
