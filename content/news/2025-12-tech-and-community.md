Happy Sunday, Rex Manor!

Following up on the holiday events, I wanted to share a few more happenings around town this week. One of the best things about living in Mountain View is having world-class technology and culture right in our backyard.

### The Future of Humanoid Robots
This Thursday, **December 11**, the **[Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/events/)** is hosting a fascinating event: *The Future of Humanoid Robots*. It starts at 7:00 p.m. It’s a great reminder of the incredible innovation happening right here in our city. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just curious about where the future is headed, this should be an inspiring evening.

### Best of SF Stand-Up Comedy
If you're looking for some laughs, the **Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts** is hosting the **[Best of SF Stand-Up Comedy](https://www.mvcpa.com/events)** on Friday, **December 12** at 8:00 p.m. It’s always nice to have top-tier entertainment just a short drive (or bike ride) away.

### Wellness at the Google Visitor Experience
For a mid-week break, the **Google Visitor Experience** at the Huddle is offering **Everyday Wellness with Monica Ubungen** on Wednesday, **December 10** from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. It’s wonderful to see our local tech companies opening up their spaces for community health and connection.

### Shaping Our Parks
I also noticed some buzz on the **[Rex Manor Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors)** about the **Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan**. As our city continues to grow and evolve, it’s important that our public spaces adapt to meet the needs of all residents. The draft plan is available for review, and I encourage everyone to take a look and offer feedback. It’s a positive way to help guide the character of our neighborhood for years to come.

Speaking of the Google Group, it’s been great to see neighbors helping neighbors recently—whether it’s sharing plumber recommendations or just keeping an eye out for each other. That supportive spirit is what makes Rex Manor such a special place to live.

Have a great week!
