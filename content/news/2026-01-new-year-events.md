Happy New Year, Rex Manor!

I hope everyone had a restful holiday season. As we settle into 2026, I wanted to highlight some of the exciting events and updates happening right here in Mountain View this month. We are incredibly lucky to live in a city that balances a cozy neighborhood feel with world-class innovation and culture.

### Computer History Museum Events
One of the best things about living in Rex Manor is our proximity to the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/). It’s a constant reminder of the incredible technological heritage of our region.

*   **Free Day | Museums on Us:** If you haven't visited in a while, this Sunday, **January 4, 2026**, is a great opportunity. The museum is offering free admission for Bank of America and Merrill cardholders as part of the "Museums on Us" program.
*   **"Read Me":** Mark your calendars for **Tuesday, January 20, 2026, at 7:00 PM**. The museum is hosting an event titled "Read Me," which promises to be an engaging look into the intersection of technology and human stories.

### Arts and Culture at MVCPA
The [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) has a fantastic lineup to start the year. Supporting our local arts scene is a great way to keep our community vibrant.

*   **For the Kids:** The Peninsula Youth Theatre presents **"The Adventures of Pinocchio"** on **January 17**. This is perfect for a family outing.
*   **TheatreWorks:** Starting **January 17**, catch **"Hershey Felder: The Piano and Me."** Felder is a phenomenal performer, and this show tells the story behind his thousands of performances. It runs through late January, so there are plenty of chances to see it.

### City Services
Just a reminder that the New Year’s holiday schedule affects our trash collection. Since New Year's Day (Jan 1) fell on a Thursday, **collection service is delayed by one day for the rest of the week**.

*   If your regular collection day is **Thursday**, your bins will be picked up on **Friday, Jan 2**.
*   If your regular collection day is **Friday**, your bins will be picked up on **Saturday, Jan 3**.

Regular schedules resume next week. Also, keep in mind that **City of Mountain View offices** have reopened as of Friday, January 2, following the holiday closure.

### Stay Connected
Finally, if you haven't already, please make sure to check in on the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group. It’s the best place to jump into lively discussions about our neighborhood and stay in the loop on spontaneous gatherings or topics that might not make it to the blog.

Here’s to a wonderful 2026!
