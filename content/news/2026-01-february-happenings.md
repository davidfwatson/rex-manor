### Celebrate the Year of the Horse
The City of Mountain View is hosting its annual **Lunar New Year Celebration** on **Saturday, February 28, 2026**.

This is always a fantastic community event with live performances, crafts, and food trucks. It’s a great way to welcome the Year of the Horse with neighbors and friends.

### Get Creative at Hacker Dojo
We are lucky to have the [Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.com/) (855 Maude Ave) so close to us. It’s a hub of innovation and creativity that really embodies the spirit of our region. They have a packed schedule this month:

*   **Build & Chill Project Jam:** On **Wednesday, Feb 4**, join fellow builders and tinkerers for a casual evening of collaboration. Whether you have a project to show off or just want to see what others are making, it’s a welcoming environment.

*   **Ultimate Board Gamers:** Wrap up the month on **Saturday, Feb 28**, with a board game night. From strategy epics to party games, there’s something for everyone.

### Arts & Culture at MVCPA
The [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) continues to offer world-class entertainment downtown.

*   **The Snow Queen:** On **February 1**, catch this magical performance that is sure to delight families.
*   **Love is Love:** Just in time for Valentine's Day, this performance runs on **February 13 & 14**.

### Last Chance: Retro Games at CHM
If you haven't seen the **Retro Games** exhibit at the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/), time is running out! The exhibit ends on **February 16, 2026**. It’s a nostalgic trip through the history of video games that highlights the incredible engineering and design evolution of the industry.

While you're there, note that the museum is also hosting the **SmallSat Symposium** (Feb 10-12), bringing together leaders in the satellite industry. It’s exciting to see such forward-looking discussions happening right in our backyard.

### Neighborhood Updates
Don't forget to keep an eye on the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group. It’s the best place for day-to-day discussions, quick questions, and coordinating meetups that might pop up on short notice.

Looking forward to seeing you around the neighborhood!
