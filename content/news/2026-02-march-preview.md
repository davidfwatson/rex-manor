Happy Valentine's Day, neighbors!

As we enjoy the last few weeks of winter, the calendar for March is already filling up with some fantastic local events. Whether you are interested in cutting-edge science, sustainability, or supporting our local youth, there is something for everyone just a short trip from Rex Manor.

### The Amazing Nature of Animal Senses

First up, the **Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts (MVCPA)** is hosting a truly fascinating event. On **Tuesday, March 3, 2026, at 7:00 PM**, Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer **Ed Yong** will be presenting **"The Amazing Nature of Animal Senses."**

Based on his bestselling book *An Immense World*, this talk promises to take us beyond the limits of human perception to explore how other creatures experience the world. It is a wonderful example of how science can expand our understanding and appreciation of nature. This event is presented by the Peninsula Open Space Trust (POST), and tickets are available through the [MVCPA website](https://www.mvcpa.com/events).

### Repair Café at Hacker Dojo

For those of us who love to tinker—or just hate throwing things away—**Hacker Dojo** (855 Maude Ave) is hosting a **Repair Café** on **Sunday, March 29, 2026, from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM**.

This is a brilliant community initiative where volunteers help you fix broken household items, electronics, bikes, and more—for free! It is technology at its best: practical, sustainable, and community-driven. Instead of discarding that toaster or lamp, bring it down to the Dojo and give it a second life. You can learn more at the [Repair Café Silicon Valley website](https://repaircafesv.org/).

While you are there, check out the Dojo itself—it is a cornerstone of our local tech scene and a great place to meet fellow makers and innovators.

### Peninsula Youth Theatre: Newsies

Support our local young talent! The **Peninsula Youth Theatre (PYT)** will be performing Disney's **"Newsies"** at the MVCPA from **March 14 through March 22**.

It is always inspiring to see the dedication and skill of our community's youth. These shows are high-energy, fun for the whole family, and a great way to spend an afternoon or evening downtown. Tickets and showtimes are available at [pyt.org](https://pyt.org/).

### Join the Discussion

As always, if you hear of other great events or want to organize a meetup before heading to one of these, jump onto the **[rex-manor-neighbors Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors)**. It is the best place to share news, ask questions, and stay connected with your neighbors.

Here is to a curious and connected March!
