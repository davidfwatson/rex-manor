Happy New Year, neighbors!

After the holiday rush, it feels good to settle back into the rhythm of daily life here in Rex Manor. I’ve been taking a look at what’s coming up in Mountain View for the rest of January and February, and I have to say, it’s a great time to be here. We have some fantastic opportunities to engage with the tech community, shape the future of our city, and enjoy the arts.

### Innovation in Our Backyard
We often talk about the tech industry in the abstract, but one of the perks of living here is having front-row access to the people building the future.

*   **Hacker Dojo Events:** If you haven't been to the [Hacker Dojo](https://hackerdojo.org/) recently (located at 855 Maude Ave), it's worth checking out. They have a **Rust Meetup** coming up this Thursday, **January 8**, which is a great chance for developers to connect.
*   **Smart Living Silicon Valley 2026:** On **Saturday, January 10**, the Dojo is also hosting the **AI Hardware & Robotics Summit**. Events like these remind me why Mountain View is such a special place—innovation isn't just happening in big office parks; it's happening in community spaces right down the road.

### Shaping Our City’s Future
There are a couple of city initiatives moving forward that I think are really positive steps for Mountain View.

*   **Dark Sky Ordinance:** You might remember seeing discussions about this on the [neighborhood Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rex-manor-neighbors) late last year. The city is currently in the **Draft Ordinance Development** phase (Q1 2026). This initiative aims to reduce light pollution and preserve our view of the night sky—something I think we can all appreciate. Keep an eye out for public hearings expected later this spring (Q2).
*   **Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan:** The draft plan was released for review recently. As our neighborhood and city continue to grow and evolve, having a solid roadmap for our parks is crucial. I’d encourage everyone to take a look and see what’s proposed for our shared spaces.

### A Winter Treat at MVCPA
For a change of pace, the [Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts](https://www.mvcpa.com/) has a lovely production coming up at the end of the month.

*   **The Snow Queen:** Presented by TheaterGames Productions, this show runs from **January 31 to February 1**. It sounds like a wonderful, whimsical performance for families or anyone looking to enjoy some local theater.

### Stay Involved
As always, the **rex-manor-neighbors** Google Group is a great place to discuss these topics. Whether you’re interested in the new lighting standards or want to coordinate a group to head to the Hacker Dojo, it’s always good to connect.

Here’s to a bright and innovative 2026!
